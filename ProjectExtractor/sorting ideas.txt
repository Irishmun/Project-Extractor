searching and sorting systems:
current:(top to bottom searching) (presumed fastest)
1. get first keyword with value, append newline beforehand
2. get remaining keywords with values
3. look for and get date between chapterstart and chapterend

new idea: (per project searching) (allows for easier project content sorting)
1. get all keywords with values, ignoring order (put inside array)
2. once chapterstart/end or already found keyword is found, sort found keywords by order
3. look for and get date between chapterstart and chapterend

newer idea: (search after file finished) (less memory efficient, allows for more search options)
1. get all desired contents (keyword values, datetimechapters, etc.) and put them in struct
2. put all structs inside list for later
3. once done, sort all contents of structs and put them all from list to file
